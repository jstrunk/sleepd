  * Fix arch all/any confusion. Closes: #358169

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 21 Mar 2006 14:15:58 -0500

  * Fix missing break in --hibernate-command parsing. Closes: #352770

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 14 Feb 2006 10:47:07 -0500

sleepd (1.3.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix incorrect detection of plug swap events.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 11 Feb 2006 18:42:35 -0500

sleepd (1.3.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * On acpi systems, default to "hibernate --force" if no sleep command
    is specified.
  * No longer go to sleep while on AC power unless --ac-unused is set.
    Closes: #100087
  * Recommend hibernate | apmd.
  * Adjusted some bits like the init script that claimed it was APM specific.
  * Fix path to control file on sleepctl man page.
  * Patch based on a patch by Wolfgang Karall to add a --hibernate-command
    option, which can be used to specify a different command to run when
    the battery is low vs when sleeping due to inactivity.
  * Treat AC plug/unplug events as activity. Closes: #348386
  * Allow specifying a --battery number of 0, which was previously invalid.
    May be useful on hardware where the acpi battery calculations fall below
    zero when the battery is very depleted, to make the system sleep at the
    very last minute. This is experimental.
  * Merge in changes from procmeter3's version of acpi.c, made by Andrew M.
    Bishop, that avoid the ugly chdir to /proc/acpi and add a bit of error
    checking. Now fully synced with procmeter3 3.4d and wmbattery 2.24.
  * Patch from Stephen Gildea to acpi.c to deal with his laptop, which
    sometimes reports the battery is discharging when when it's plugged in,
    so discharge status cannot be used to imply offline status.
  * Slightly modified patch to still avoid calling on_ac_power() in
    obvious cases.
  * Also, logic error fix to the zero batteries implies it must be plugged in
    code.
  * Rewrote package description.
  * Make arch all, since libapm-dev is now available on all arches.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 30 Jan 2006 17:57:34 -0500

sleepd (1.2.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Run PARAMS through one extra variable expansion in the start-stop-daemon
    call to allow it to contain multiple settings, and quoted strings such
    as --sleep-command 'apm -S'

sleepd (1.2.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Only warn once about no keyboard or mouse irqs, not every update.
    Closes: #226389, although it still probably has 2.6 kernel issues.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue,  6 Jan 2004 20:05:06 -0500

sleepd (1.2.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Recognise i8042 in /proc/interrupts as a keyboard/mouse. 2.5 kernels
    report by chipset apparently. Update documentation with more detials.
    Closes: #193183

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 13 May 2003 17:07:40 -0400

sleepd (1.2.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added apm.h with newer apm symbols needed to build sleepd on older
    systems.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 16 Sep 2002 13:50:01 -0400

sleepd (1.2.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * sync acpi.c with wmbattery 2.11. Cf #152356

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 10 Jul 2002 16:11:57 -0400

sleepd (1.2.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated acpi.c from wmbattery 2.10. Cf #149715

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 11 Jun 2002 22:55:32 -0400

sleepd (1.2.3) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 27 May 2002 11:32:37 -0400

sleepd (1.2.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * ACPI support. Have to use software suspend to sleep though (unless you're
    Linus or something), and so there is some manual tweaking required.
  * Changed the default check period to 10 seconds, as ACPI is a mite more
    expensive, and anything under a minute should really be fine.
  * Support use of -b w/o -U flag.
  * Support -u 0 to disable idle checking.
  * Made -s actually work.
  * debhelper v4

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 24 May 2002 13:28:47 -0400

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 24 Feb 2002 12:33:57 -0500

sleepd (1.1.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Renamed this package and the daemon from apm-sleep to sleepd,
    after observing that apmsleep is a program in the apm package.
    Anyway, daemons should end in 'd'.
  * Remove any sleepd.ctl on purge.
  * The magic in the preinst should transition both conffiles transparently
    to the admin.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 16 Nov 2001 18:30:39 -0500

apm-sleep (1.1.8) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 22 Jun 2001 22:22:43 -0400

apm-sleep (1.1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed two typos that prevented it from ever sleeping except in low
    power situations.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 21 Jun 2001 21:30:35 -0400

apm-sleep (1.1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved the apm-sleep control file to /var/run/, so it is removed on
    reboots. I want the control data to persist accross daemon restarts,
    but not reboots.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 15 Jun 2001 20:37:33 -0400

apm-sleep (1.1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added -b flag to make the system go to sleep if the battery gets low.
  * Recommends apmd.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 10 Jun 2001 23:16:56 -0400

apm-sleep (1.1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * More sane IPC.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu,  7 Jun 2001 18:59:30 -0400

apm-sleep (1.1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a status command to sleepctl.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed,  6 Jun 2001 03:27:17 -0400

apm-sleep (1.1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added sleepctl program.
  * Removed bogus changelog entry that was meant for wmbattery (so _that's_
    where the mysterious missing changelog entry went!).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon,  4 Jun 2001 23:35:06 -0400

apm-sleep (1.0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made the init script ensure that the apm module is loaded by
    touching /dev/apm_bios. Closes: #95792

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 30 Apr 2001 13:21:14 -0400

apm-sleep (1.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Clean up .o file, Closes: #85608

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 11 Feb 2001 15:31:34 -0800

apm-sleep (1.0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Debhelper installs the default file now for me.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri,  9 Feb 2001 18:16:17 -0800

apm-sleep (1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added install target to Makefile.
  * Added local website mantainance install-hook in.
  * Created a website.
  * Added another copy of the GPL to my cvs repository. Sigh.
  * Added INSTALL document.
  * First public release outside Debian.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed,  7 Feb 2001 22:16:54 -0800

apm-sleep (0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * I discovered that apm-sleep would run before X or gpm were started, and
    there would be no mouse irq in the list, so it would not autoprobe it.
    The fix is to make it autoprobe for keyboard and mouse every time
    through the main loop. I do this with pretty little additional
    overhead, really. It should also make autoprobing work if a device is
    connected or enabled or whatever when the daemon is running (I'm
    thinking USB..) Closes: #80173

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 21 Dec 2000 17:32:05 -0800

apm-sleep (0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patch from Stephen Rothwell <sfr@linuxcare.com.au> to:
    - add ac-unused option
    - add some paramater checking
    - add check-time option
  * Added a new TODO item to replace the one Steven did.
  * Build-depends on apmd now.
  * Modified above patch a bit. -U 0 will disable sleep completly
    when on wall power, and if -U is not specified, it defaults to
    using whatever the regular suspend time is.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 12 Dec 2000 22:59:12 -0800

apm-sleep (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

apm-sleep (0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * First release.
